	<h1>About Respect<span id="her">[HER]</span>Tech</h1>
	
	<p id="aboutme">Respect<span id="her">[HER]</span>Tech is a brand founded by @LyssaDaCode. <br> <br> This brand represents the females looking to join the Tech community, <br> but don't know where to begin or how to include it into their current lifestyles. <br> Some of us women get called too "ditsy", too "bubbly", too "feminine". <br> But last time I checked, that has nothing to do <br> with our dedication to succeed and work in a field that is dominated by men. <br> Now, I've always been in male-dominated careers. <br> I was a Car Technician for about 2 years and I always heard "Do you know what you're doing ma'am?" <br> or "Can I have that MAN assist me?" when in reality, I was more experienced than ALL of my male coworkers. <br> But, since I'm "female", I get the boot from customers. <br> I was also an Audio Engineer at a couple of recording studios, <br> and although it wasn't AS sexist as the Car Technician job, <br> I still experienced moments where I was excluded from a project because <br> I am just a girl and I don't have "MALE Engineer Ears"... I though Engineer Ears were Engineer Ears, <br> I didn't know it was based on gender. I can go on and on, like Badu says. I began working in Tech back in May <br> and I must say, although I am fully aware of the men who overpower our success, <br> I still found a passion for it and I don't want to give up on it. I actually want <br> to combine my love for music with my love for tech. I aspire to take <br> the "Male Dominated" engineering field and merge it into the "Male Dominated" tech field and TAKE. OVER. <br> Respect<span id="her">[HER]</span>Tech is here to provide simplified resources and content for your tech journey. <br> I hope to keep you on your toes and encourage you to join our movement. <br> Sign up for my email list below for weekly emails, resources, and motivation. <br> Read on to view my samples and resume.</p>
